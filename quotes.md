Cursing is invoking the assistance of a spirit to help you inflict suffering. Swearing on the other hand, is invoking, only the witness of a spirit to an statement you wish to make. John Ruskin

Swearing is industry language. For as long as we're alive it's not going to change. You've got to be boisterous to get results. Gordon Ramsay

Swearing's my release. It's the one weapon I have to defend myself against destiny when it elects to strike without pity. Andrea Pirlo

My first outdoor cooking memories are full of erratic British summers, Dad swearing at a barbecue that he couldn't put together, and eventually eating charred sausages, feeling brilliant. Jamie Oliver

There is no such thing as too much swearing. Swearing is just a piece of linguistic mechanics. The words in-between are the clever ones. Peter Capaldi
